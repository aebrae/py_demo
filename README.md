# py_demo
Automation script to process and upload new products(text & image files) to an eCommerce website running Django framework. Images and text files uploaded separately, using two different REST API endpoints. After upload is complete, a PDF is automatically generated based on the new products and another script attaches and sends an email to the new products supplier as confirmation. Final script automatically sends an email if something is wrong with the server.
